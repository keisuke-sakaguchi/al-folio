I am an associate professor at Tohoku University. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Psycholinguistics.
My long-term research goals are 

1. to understand human intelligence, especially natural langauge processing, and 
2. to build embodied AI that is as robust and efficient as humans. 

More specifically, my research interests include: robust NLP models for noisy texts (e.g., text normalization, parsing, automated grammatical error correction), 
commonsense knowledge acquisition and reasoning, NLP for educational purposes (first and second language acquisition), text generation (decoding algorithms), efficient data collection, and reliable evaluation metric design (meta-evaluation).
