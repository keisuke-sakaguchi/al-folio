I am a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Psycholinguistics.
My long-term research goals are 

1. to understand human intelligence, especially natural langauge processing
2. to build embodied AI that is as robust and efficient as humans. 

More specifically, my research interests include: robust NLP models for noisy texts (e.g., text normalization, parsing, automated grammatical error correction), 
commonsense knowledge acquisition and reasoning, NLP for educational purposes (first and second language acquisition), and efficient and reliable data collection and evaluation metrics.
I received my Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP).
